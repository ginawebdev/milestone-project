				<img src="img/headshot.png" alt="headshot" />
					<p>I'm passionate about all things code! <br> I've been interested in Web Development for years, it wasn't until I found Skillcrush that I decided to leap and I'm so glad that I did. All aspects with code and design fascinate me, while the basis may be similar, no two projects are ever the same. I approach everyday with excitement to learn new things and to create new websites.<br> Can't wait to work with you!</p>
